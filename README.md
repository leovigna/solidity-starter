# Solidity Starter Project

Solidity starter project.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Save storage with [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/). You can also use regular NPM or Yarn.

```
pnpm install
```

### Directory Structure
```
lib
├── abi # abi output from src/
|
├── ethers # ethers contract abstractions codegenned from abis only (no bytecode)
│
├── solidity # the contracts themselves, in .sol form
│
├── truffle  # truffle contract abstractions codegenned from abis + bytecode
|
└── web3  # web3 contract abstractions codegenned from abis + bytecode
```

### Usage
These smart contracts can be imported as a dependency in various ways described below.

#### Solidity
The solidity smart contracts themselves can simply be imported via the `solidity` directory of `@leovigna/solidity-starter`.

```solidity
import "@leovigna/solidity-starter/solidity/Example.sol";
```

#### Artifacts
JSON artifacts generated by sol-compiler are available under the abi directory.

```typescript
import ExampleArtifact from '@leovigna/solidity-starter/abi/Example.json';
```

#### Ethers
This library ships with ethers.js contract abstractions generated by typechain. To use these, make sure you have ethers.js installed as a dependency:
```
pnpm install ethers@^4.0.44 --save
```
You can then create an ethers contract as follows:
```typescript
import ExampleEthers from '@leovigna/solidity-starter/ethers/Example';
const example = ExampleEthers(address, new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545'));
```
This gives a fully typed (if using TypeScript) version of a ethers.js contract factory. See the ethers.js documentation on usage.

Truffle
This library ships with @truffle/contract abstractions of each of our smart contracts. To use these, make sure you have @truffle/contract as a dependency.

# via Yarn
$ yarn add @truffle/contract@^4.1.8

# via npm
$ npm install @truffle/contract@^4.1.8 --save
If you wanted to consume the v0.4.x version of our Oracle with JavaScript, you could do the following:

const { Oracle } = require('@chainlink/contracts/truffle/v0.4/Oracle')

### Cloning

To clone this starter repo and add it as an upstream folow below:

```
git clone https://github.com/leovigna/solidity-starter.git myproject
cd myproject
git remote set-url origin git@github.com/leovigna/myproject.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/leovigna/solidity-starter.git
git push origin master
git push --all
```

Then to sync any new changes form this repo to the new repo follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork).

```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

### Testing
